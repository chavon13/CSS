        <p> Chiweenies are a mix between a Chihuahua and a weiner dog. I happen to have a 
            chiweenie and they are a very special breed. The sweet temperament comes from their 
            Daschund side. The shyness comes from their Chihuahua side. Hopefully this is enough
            wording to actually show up in my main window. I don't think it will be enugh to scroll.
            if it isn't I'll add that Latin.
